<eagle4>Introduction</eagle4>

<p class="indent1">
Please <b>read this page</b> and then click on the link to a 
list of on-line <b>examples</b> at the [link: #bottom bottom]
of this page.

EagleClaw is based on the <a href="http://www.clawpack.org">Clawpack Version
5.0</a>
software, primarily designed for solving hyperbolic systems of conservation
laws.  
</p><p class="indent1">
EagleClaw provides a web-page interface to Clawpack with the following goals:
<ul>
<li> To allow those studying hyperbolic problems to experiment
with several examples without the need to download and install code or
read a user's manual.
</p><p class="indent1">
<li> To allow potential users of Clawpack to try it out before downloading
and installing.
</p><p class="indent1">
<li> To provide a simplifed interface that may be useful also for those
modifying and running Clawpack on their own computer.  A web server is easy
to start in Python on your local machine to serve your own EagleClaw pages
(see <a href="../README.html">claw/README</a>).
</p><p class="indent1">
<li> To facilitate on-line documentation of the Clawpack software using a
new approach to <a href="http://www.amath.washington.edu/~rjl/lprr.html">
Literate Programming</a>.
html pages are generated from Fortran and Python programs using
[doc:clawcode2html.html clawcode2html], a version of
[http://www.amath.washington.edu/~rjl/mathcode2html/ mathcode2html]
designed for use with Clawpack.  
See <a href="../examples/acoustics/1d/example1/rp1ac.f.html">the Riemann solver for
acoustics</a> for an example.
<p>
<li> Clawpack documentation is now being develped in Sphinx, see
[link: ../doc/sphinx/_build Clawpack 5.0 documentation].
</ul>

</p>
<eagle4>Browser issues</eagle4><p class="indent1">
These web pages were designed using Firefox and they work reliably
with Firefox on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
</p><p class="indent1">
They don't seem to work always with Safari or Internet Explorer, for
reasons
not yet understood.



</p>
<eagle4>jsMath issues</eagle4>
<p class="indent1">
Some of these web pages use <a
href="http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/welcome.html">jsMath</a> to
display mathematics typeset in latex.  If this equation:
</p><p class="indent1">
    \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} q(x,t) + 
       \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(q(x,t)) = 0   \]
</p><p class="indent1">
looks like
latex instead of being typeset, you probably need to
<a href="http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/users/fonts.html">
install some fonts</a>, which is easy to do.  

</p><p class="indent1">
Click on the jsMath icon in the lower
corner for some other useful things.
